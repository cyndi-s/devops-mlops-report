**A GitHub Actions–based application for commit-level DevOps + MLOps reporting.**

---

## Overview

`devops-mlops-report` is a research-driven software prototype that generates structured **commit-level DevOps and MLOps summaries** for machine learning repositories.

The project explores how CI signals, model training metadata, and workflow
context can be unified into a single, repository-native report.

## Project Status

- **Phase 1** — Architecture validation (completed)
- **Phase 2** — End-to-end demo (completed)
- **Phase 3** — Feature expansion and refinement (in progress)

---

## Context

This repository contains an evolving **software application** that investigates
how DevOps and MLOps signals can be unified and reported at the CI level.

The system is designed to be lightweight, repository-driven, and backend-free.

Formal problem formulation, evaluation, and analysis will be presented separately.
